# Hyperloop2022

The G.U.I. and Arduino code that I wrote when I was part of Warwick Hyperloop (2022-2023)

# Arduino Boards
An Arudino Mega was connected to the relevant electronics and sensors inside the pod. One of these components was the NRF24l01 transceiver, which communicated with another attached to an Arduino nana, which in turn was connected to a laptop.

This system allowed data from the sensors on the Arduino Mega to be read and displayed on a G.U.I. made using HTML and CSS.
